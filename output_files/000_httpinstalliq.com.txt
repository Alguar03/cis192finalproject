                 <h3>What is InstallIQ</h3>

                    <p>InstallIQ is an installation manager that will help you through the download and installation process, making it as easy as possible for you to get the product you are looking for. Don’t worry! When using InstallIQ, you can be assured that your download is completely safe. And because we want you to have control over what you are downloading, we have made sure that InstallIQ follows these three principles:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Choice – choose the software you value</li>
                        <li>Consent – additional software is only installed with your consent</li>
                        <li>Control – you have the control to accept,  decline, or exit at any time</li>
                      </ul>
                    
                    <p>Every product that is run through the InstallIQ manager is free. But, in order to make this happen, InstallIQ shows you advertisements during the installation process. Your support of these advertisements, which are all safe and free to download, helps poor, but brilliant, app developers make money from their free and awesome software.</p>
                    <p>How does InstallIQ work? <br /><a href="#" class="prcessImg"><img src="images/process_v2.png" alt="InstallIQ Process" title="InstallIQ Process" /></a></p>

                    <p>InstallIQ is completely safe to use. Although, if you don’t believe us, you should know that every product and advertised software that you see during the process is run through an extensive Quality Assurance (“QA”) process before they are ever shown to you. And if that’s not enough, continued QA checks are run the entire time that any product or advertised software is live in our network. Part of these QA processes are to check every app with a plethora of the most up-to-date security software, such as Symantec, Norton, McAfee, and more, because we hate nasty software that messes up your computer just as much as you do.</p>
