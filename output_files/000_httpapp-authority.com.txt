            <h2>About App Authority</h2>
            <h3>What is App Authority?</h3>
            <p>For consumers, App Authority is a website/service which presents listings of a variety of popular applications, products, and services on and off Facebook ("Apps").  For App developers and other advertisers, App Authority helps acquire new customers by helping consumers become aware of their products and services.</p>
            <h3>How are App Authority listings chosen for inclusion on the site, and how are they ranked?</h3>
            <p>Listings are selected and rank-ordered by App Authority editors and/or App Authority algorithms.  Such decisions are influenced significantly by each App's proven ability to successfully promote itself via paid advertising through an ad network elsewhere on the internet.</p>
            <h3>Listings sometimes include stars - what do those mean?</h3>
            <p>Stars, when present, reflect App Authority editors' and/or algorithms' opinions regarding each App's proven ability to promote themselves using paid advertising elsewhere on the internet.  For example, more stars indicates App Authority's opinion that a particular App has proven a stronger ability than many other Apps to promote itself using paid advertising elsewhere on the Internet - whereas fewer stars indicates App Authority's opinion that a given App has not proven as much ability to successfully promote itself using paid advertising elsewhere on the Internet. </p>
            <h3>Why does App Authority use "an App's ability to successfully promote itself via paid advertising" as a selection criteria?</h3>
            <p>App Authority believes that "an App's ability to successfully promote itself via paid advertising" is a strong indicator for the quality and popularity of an App.  We believe most Apps are of low quality - in part because it has become so easy to create an App.  Due to their low quality, these Apps typically have little or no success when trying to promote themselves using paid advertising.  Conversely, we believe that only high quality Apps are typically successful when trying to promote themselves using paid advertising.  </p>
            <h3>If I am an App developer:</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Can I buy an App Authority listing if I want to promote my App?</dt>
                <dd>No, not directly.  Specific listings are not sold on a direct paid insertion basis.  Rather, listings change regularly, and are determined by App Authority editors and/or algorithms.  </dd>
                <dt>How can I get my App listed on App Authority?</dt>
                <dd>The first step is to demonstrate to App Authority editors your App's ability to successfully promote itself with paid advertising elsewhere on the Internet through an ad network.  You can do this by setting up one or more performance-based advertising campaigns with an ad network.</dd>
                <dd>If / when your App proves its ability to successfully promote itself through an ad network using paid advertising elsewhere on the Internet, your App will become eligible for inclusion in App Authority listings.  At this point, App Authority editors and algorithms will automatically consider your App for inclusion. </dd>
                <dd>If / when App Authority editors and/or algorithms elect to include your App in App Authority listings, and new app installations occur as a result, you will be charged for such app installations on a performance basis.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Does App Authority make money?  If so, how?</h3>
            <p>Yes, App Authority is a for profit service.  App Authority listings are not ads, and cannot be purchased in a direct way like ads.  However, somewhat like an affiliate company, App Authority does receive performance-based payment (through an ad network) for customer acquisition activity that occurs as a result of App Authority.</p>
