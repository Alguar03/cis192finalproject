<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/senate-resumes-debating-us-postal-service/2012/04/16/gIQAJhQLMT_blog.html?wprss=rss_politics">The Senate</a> is turning its attention back to the Postal Service, which "everyone" agrees is in crisis. That is to say, the Postal Service is a victim both of legitimate shifts in how we live our lives and communicate with our loved ones and of a manufactured crisis resulting from simultaneous congressional demands that it "run like a business" and congressional restrictions preventing it from running like a business in ways that would help.
<p>The policy world debate over what to do about the Postal Service centers around cuts cuts cuts: Should post offices and processing centers be closed or just downsized? Should Saturday delivery be cut now or in a couple years? And so on. There are other possibilities that would bring the possibility of the Postal Service adapting more fully to the rise of the internet; for instance, a report conducted for the National Association of Letter Carriers by Ron Bloom, who headed up President Obama's auto rescue, finds that leading proposals for cuts would worsen the situation (manufacture more crisis, in other words), <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304818404577348250599030454.html?mod=rss_whats_news_us&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wsj%2Fxml%2Frss%2F3_7011+%28WSJ.com%3A+What%27s+News+US%29">and suggests that</a>:<br /></p>
<blockquote>[...] the agency should raise its stamp prices, which are among the lowest in the world, and find new ways to profit more from its built-in advantage as the only entity to reach every American home every day. It should also replace its multilayered governance system with a corporate- style board of directors whose members have entrepreneurial experience.</blockquote>
Running government like a business is always a <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/04/17/967855/-Running-government-like-a-business-?detail=hide">terrible idea</a>. Saying that the Postal Service should be like a business in being profitable while not having the ability to raise prices or expand its offerings says you want it to fail. The Senate's postal bill has improved slightly in recent weeks, but stays in the established policy debate in which the question is not how to adapt but what to cut.

<p><a href="http://www.epi.org/blog/tax-day-facts-numbers/">In fact</a>, "The <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/buffett-rule-needed-restore-tax-fairness/">400 highest income filers paid an average tax rate of 16.6 percent</a> in 2007 (before the Great Recession)" and "In 2011, the top 1 percent of households by cash income received <a href="http://www.epi.org/blog/tax-expenditure-1-percent/">75.1 percent of the benefit from the preferential treatment of capital gains and dividends</a>. The middle class, meanwhile, received only 3.9 percent of that benefit." No wonder that, while a plurality of Americans believe they pay too much income tax, <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/17/1084107/-More-Americans-concerned-about-tax-system-benefiting-wealthy-than-lowering-their-own-taxes?detail=hide">far more believe the system benefits the rich</a>. But it's not just the wealthy: Tax rates are lower even for average families and corporate tax revenues are a much smaller share of the economy than was historically the case.</p>
<p>All of this matters, because if the deficit continues to be fetishized and we let wealthy individuals and corporations pay less than their fair share, the only thing left on the table is massive cuts to programs we all care about. Programs that could be paid for by cutting tax deductions and loopholes, including first and foremost the low tax rates on investment income.<br /></p>

<p>Just a little tax day reminder of some things Republican politicians are trying really hard to make us forget.</p>

PPP (<a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_FL_417.pdf">PDF</a>). Florida voters. April 12-15. ±3.7%. (11/28-12/1 <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/12/florida-shows-perils-of-gingrich-for-gop-1.html">results</a>)<br />
<blockquote><strong>Obama:</strong> 50 (45)<br />
<strong>Romney:</strong> 45 (44)</blockquote>
PPP's Tom Jensen says this is the biggest lead for Obama over Romney in Florida since PPP started polling in 2011. So despite his finally capturing the GOP nomination over Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich—Mitt Romney not only can't close the deal, he's falling further behind.
<p>The GOP's problems aren't just at the top of the ticket, either. Their bench in Florida is weak:<br /></p>
<blockquote>We also looked at how four prominent Florida Republicans- Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Allen West, and Rick Scott- might affect the race as Vice Presidential candidates. Only Bush has a positive impact for Romney, bringing the race within three points at 49-46.</blockquote>
When the only candidate to give you a boost is a George W. Bush's brother, you know you're in rough shape. Romney's problems stem from an extraordinarily massive gender gap. Romney actually leads among men by 10 points, 53-43. But among women, President Obama has a massive 16-point lead, 55-39. If these kinds of numbers hold, Florida in 2012 may shape up to be almost as close as it was in 2008—when Obama won by 2.5 percent—but with a radically different gender gap. In 2008, the gap was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=FLP00p1">just 1 point</a>—in this survey, it's 26.

<div class="dkimg-cap">(Greenpeace)</div>
<br /></div>
Throughout the broadcast media where most people get their "news," coverage of climate change is not exactly what you'd call extensive. There are plenty of reasons why this should <em><strong>not</strong></em> be the case. For instance, Congress is now brimful of climate-change "skeptics," a euphemism for "deniers." These folks are either so ignorant they shouldn't be allowed anywhere near public office or so glued to the lies of their Koch-contributors that they shouldn't be allowed anywhere near public office. Then there is, of course, the reality of climate change itself. Which hasn't gone away.
<p>The president himself won't use the term in speeches even on something as relevant to the climate-change discussion as energy policy. But he, at least, has reasons. No doubt his advisors argue against bringing the issue up in an election year given that the percentage of Americans who worry about global warming is well below what it was <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/153653/Americans-Worries-Global-Warming-Slightly.aspx">a dozen years ago</a>.</p>
<p>But the media have no excuse other than that their bosses, both overt and behind the scenes, don't care to enlighten readers and viewers on the subject.</p>
<p>As Media Matters <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/201204160010">points out</a> in a new study, coverage of climate change has plunged recently. Not that it was all that great to begin with. Nightly news coverage fell 72 percent between 2009 and 2011. That is, nightly news coverage on NBC, ABC, CBS went from two hours in 2009 to just 27 minutes in 2010 and 38 minutes in 2011. (Fox has no nightly news program.)</p>
<p>Think about that for a moment. Coverage of the most important issue of our era on the most-watched broadcast news programs <em>for three years</em> amounted to just 185 minutes. And if you think that this is made up for by MSNBC and CNN, who do a better job, think again. Four times as many Americans get their news from the three broadcast networks as they do the cable channels. Including Fox.</p>
<p>And the Sunday shows? Even worse. In three years, 98 minutes total for four networks, including Fox. Only <em>nine</em> minutes in 2011. Over the entire period, CBS's <em>Face the Nation</em> spent four minutes on climate change. In 2011, Donald Trump got more coverage than climate change on all four networks.</p>
<p>As if this pathetic showing wasn't bad enough, those invited to speak during the paltry time allotted helped frame the issue on the "skeptical" side:<br /></p>
<blockquote>In total, 68% of the political figures interviewed or quoted by the Sunday shows were Republicans, and 32% were Democrats. In 2011, the only people interviewed or quoted about climate change on the Sunday shows were Republican politicians. Fox News Sunday was the most skewed, featuring eight Republicans and only two Democrats over the three years. [...]
<p>Our study finds that the Sunday shows consulted political and media figures on climate change, but left scientists out of the discussion. Of those hosted or interviewed on climate change, 50% were political figures—including elected officials, strategists and advisers—45% were media figures, and none were scientists. By comparison, 32% of those interviewed or quoted on the nightly news programs were political figures, and 20% were scientists. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
The agenda here is dead clear. And it seems to be working. Just one problem. Whether you are the president, a network CEO or just a spoon-fed viewer, ignoring climate change won't make it go away.

<div class="dkimg-cap">Uh, let's see ... equal pay for women? Yeah, I still don't know what to think about that. (Jim Young/Reuters)<br /></div>
</div>
It's been a week since Mitt Romney's campaign was <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/11/1082435/-Does-Mitt-Romney-support-Lilly-Ledbetter-Fair-Pay-Act-He-ll-get-back-to-us-on-that?detail=hide">first asked</a> whether he supports the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. While his campaign (eventually) <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/11/1082454/-Romney-campaign-decides-supporting-equal-pay-for-women-is-the-smart-move?detail=hide">said</a> that he supports equity pay, and his lady surrogates <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/11/1082478/-Mitt-Romney-still-has-some-splaining-to-do-on-Lilly-Ledbetter-Fair-Pay-Act?detail=hide">are telling us</a> that of <em>course</em> he supports equal pay, those very same lady surrogates voted against the Ledbetter Act. In fact, the entire Republican Party, with very few exceptions, voted against the act.
<p>A week later, Mitt still <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-diane-sawyer-sits-mitt-ann-romney/story?id=16150624&amp;singlePage=true#.T42yK-mXTdL">can't quite answer the question</a>:<br /></p>
<blockquote>DIANE SAWYER: I want to talk about a couple of issues relating to women. This 19 point difference between you and the president on women. Here are some specific questions. If you were president-- you had been president-- would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?
<p>MITT ROMNEY: It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intend-- intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago--</p>
<p>DIANE SAWYER: But would you have signed it?</p>
<p>MITT ROMNEY: --so I-- I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and-- and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to.</p>
</blockquote>
Given that Mitt Romney has been running on a platform of doing <em>exactly</em> that—running against the "prior law" known as the Affordable Care Act, which he says he plans to repeal when he's (giggle) president—Mitt's assurance that this particular prior law is perfectly safe isn't very reassuring. Back when Mitt was running for various elections in Massachusetts, claiming to be further to the left than Ted Kennedy, he also claimed to support the "prior law" of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> too. But now that Mitt's trying to prove his "severely conservative" credentials, he'd love nothing more than to see that "prior law" thrown out too.
<p>His party is firmly against not only the Ledbetter Act, but against the very concept of equal pay. His buddy in Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker, <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/06/1081265/-Scott-Walker-hopes-you-won-t-notice-he-repealed-Wisconsin-s-equal-pay-law?detail=hide">just signed</a> a bill to repeal the enforcement part of the state's equal pay law. Meanwhile, in Congress, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_Fairness_Act">Paycheck Fairness Act</a>, which would expand the 1963 Equal Pay Act, has been sitting there collecting dust because not a single Republican has signed onto it.</p>
<p>If Mitt Romney wants to assure the lady voters <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/12/1082818/-Women-flock-to-Obama-as-GOP-wages-war-on-them?detail=hide">who don't like him</a> that he's not going to get rid of equal pay, the way he plans to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/16/1083797/-Mitt-Romney-adviser-Planned-Parenthood-is-a-goner?detail=hide">get rid of Planned Parenthood</a>, he needs to say it in no uncertain terms. Besides, it's not like he can't shake the Etch A Sketch and take a completely different position tomorrow.</p>

<p>It's a day ending in Y, which means if you glance around, you'll find yet another piece of evidence showing the persistence of the gender wage gap, and Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, which means there's an actual study on pay disparities. The <a href="http://myemail.constantcontact.com/New-Study--Men-Earn-More-Than-Women-Within-Nearly-All-the-Most-Common-Occupations-.html?soid=1100380756244&amp;aid=gPrQXo5_ENc">Institute for Women's Policy Research</a> has released an analysis showing that:<br /></p>
<blockquote>[W]omen have lower median earnings than men in all but one of the 20 most common occupations for women, 'bookkeeping and auditing clerks,' where women and men have the same median earnings. In one of the twenty most common male occupations, 'stock clerks and order fillers,' women out-earned men by 3 percent of median male earnings.</blockquote>
Occupations dominated by men pay more, and then within occupations, men are paid more. But wait—it's a day ending in Y, which means that comment threads everywhere on the internet will be inundated with men mansplaining about how women just care less about money, or how various unexplained factors that are <i>definitely not sexism</i> account for any and every piece of evidence that no matter what factors you control for, the gender gap persists. Because sexism is not a science, or even a keen analysis. It's a belief system.

<div class="dkimg-cap">Is there nothing in this book but anti-sex rants?</div>
</div>
What the hell? Here's Catholic Bishop Daniel Jenky, delivering an actual sermon before a march by "Catholic men of faith" to demand women <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/04/17/466053/catholic-bishop-claims-obama-is-following-a-similar-path-to-hitler/">not be allowed to make their own damn decisions on contraception.</a><br />
<blockquote>"The Church will survive the entrenched corruption and sheer incompetence of our Illinois state government, and even the calculated disdain of the President of the United States, his appointed bureaucrats in HHS, and of the current majority of the federal Senate. . . .
<p>Hitler and Stalin, at their better moments, would just barely tolerate some churches remaining open, but would not tolerate any competition with the state in education, social services, and health care.</p>
<p>In clear violation of our First Amendment rights, Barack Obama – with his radical, pro abortion and extreme secularist agenda, now seems intent on following a similar path."</p>
</blockquote>
OK, what the <em>hell</em>? Let me get this straight. Barack Obama is <em>like Hitler</em>, and Barack Obama is <em>like Stalin</em>, because you're being oppressed with some pissant rule about how no, if you're an employer you're not allowed to demand all your non-religious employees comport their healthcare choices with your personal religious bigotries? That's the big fight? Oh my goodness, Barack Obama is so pro-abortion! Oh, he's <em>radical</em>, he's an <em>extreme secularist!</em> Somewhere some woman is getting health insurance that covers birth control pills, and that's <em>just like the Holocaust!.</em>
<p>You know what? Screw you, guy. If having some insurance company somewhere pay for some protestant woman's birth control even though she works as a secretary in an office affiliated with a Catholic-run hospital or school is such an affront to you that it's on the order of Hitler, you can just sod off right-the-hell-now, thank you very much. That's nowhere <em>near</em> the realm of "I have to treat you seriously" discourse. That's just announcing to the world that you're a big, self-important, delusional jackass.</p>
<p>I would love to see my former church (and the word <em>former</em> sounds better and better each time I type it) be as impassioned about <em>anything</em> as they are about demanding the entire world comport to their sexual demands, but apparently that's just not going to happen. I don't know of anyone who's ever been denied communion because they were pro-death-penalty. Or anti-immigrant. Or because they supported monstrous wars for monstrous reasons. Or because they introduced a budget to screw the poor, or supported that budget. I never heard a single American bishop condemn the notion of letting the sick rot or the poor starve—because that's what Deficit Jesus would want, of course—as being something comparable to Hitler or Stalin. Oh, they'll write letters. Oh, they'll maybe mention how that's not really a good thing, tsk-tsk. But it's <em>nothing</em> compared to the all-out war they will wage to make sure women <em>who are not even Catholic</em> have to abide by their bullshitted notions of what a woman's "place" is, and how she should be having sex, and <a href="http://www.thecatholicpost.com/post/PostFeatured.aspx">what the consequences of that <em>sex</em> ought to be.</a><br /></p>
<blockquote>He warned participants in the "A Call to Catholic Men of Faith" rally that Catholic schools, hospitals, and Newman Centers “could easily be shut down” by the fall of 2013 rather than cooperate with the government's mandate that most health plans cover the cost of contraception, sterilization and some drugs that can induce abortion.
<p>"No Catholic institution, under any circumstance, can ever cooperate with the intrinsic evil of killling innocent human life in the womb," the bishop said.</p>
</blockquote>
In my lifetime there have been three fights, and only three fights, that the American Catholic Church have worked themselves into all-out public relations war for. The first was, of course, abortion. The second is protecting pedophilia in their ranks. The third is demanding <em>other women</em> not be provided birth control if they are employed by someone who doesn't want them to have it. That's it. The entire modern history of my church revolves around sex. Not social justice. Not caring for others. Just the sex. The church would rather close down adoption centers than have to treat <em>the gays</em> as potential parents. The church fears it will have to shut down its Catholic hospitals rather than bow to the demand that some protestant woman who works there be provided with fucking pills, or some atheist man have coverage that includes (shudder) <em>sterilization.</em> And it's all Obama-Hitler's fault for it happening.
<p>Screw you, Mr. Bishop, your eminence, your holy protuberance, sir. If you would rather stop working for the sick or the poor than have some non-Catholic person's sex life covered by insurance, at no cost to you, with no involvement from you other than that you sign their damn paychecks as their employer, <em>do it</em> already. Go for it, nobody can or will stop you. If Jesus travelled in the company of prostitutes the least you can do is forgive some extracurricular fucking on the part of your janitors or nurses or secretaries, instead of threatening to withdraw all of your supposed good works in fear of being associated with it. I have no tolerance for this nonsense at this point, I think the church should in general be very, vary wary of getting into any conversation about Hitler and people like Hitler, and I have no notion as to why the bishops of the church believe they have the moral authority to lecture anyone on anything, at this point.</p>
<p>Rant over. Now go in peace, and maybe try doing some goddamn good deeds instead of just bullying the women of America into becoming second-class citizens subservient to the anti-sexual whims of a bunch of pompous old men in oversized hats.<br /></p>

It's a typical day in America, so here's two crazy religious homophobes commiserating with each other on how neither Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney really hate the gay folks enough to satisfy religious homophobes (and really, isn't the entire purpose of religion to allow people to judge and control other people's sex lives? It's not? How odd, I could have sworn that was it).
<p>One of the right-wing bigots in this case is Family Research Council head Tony Perkins, which makes it noteworthy because Tony Perkins is an omnipresent media voice for right-wing bigots. Want to know what a faux-religious right-wing jackass thinks about an issue? Call up Tony Perkins, he's their poster child. So here he is on the radio with <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/tony-perkins-secret-service-dont-ask-dont-tell">fellow crazy right-wing bigot Janet Mefferd</a>:<br /></p>
<blockquote><strong>Mefford:</strong> [...] But we as Christians can’t stand stop fighting on this issue, Tony, so what do we do when we’re faced with a race where maybe we feel like the candidates are way too similar on this and both of them are wrong?
<p><strong>Perkins:</strong> Yeah, you know that’s a great point. Just for a moment step back and look at the implications of this, over the weekend we saw the news of the President’s Secret Service detail in Colombia and the issue of them hiring prostitutes and now the White House is outraged about that. Actually in a meeting this morning my staff asked, ‘why should the President be upset’? It was actually legal; it was legal there to do that, so why should we be upset? Well, the fact is we intuitively know it’s wrong, there’s a moral law against that.</p>
<p>The same is true for what the President has done to the military enforcing open homosexuality in our military. You can change the law but you can’t change the moral law that’s behind it. You can change the positive law, the law that is created by man, but you can’t change the moral law, it’s wrong. So what you have is you have a total breakdown and you can’t pick and choose. Morality is not a smorgasbord; you can’t pick what you want. I think you’re absolutely right, this is a fundamental issue going forward because if we say ‘let them do what we want,’ what’s next? You cannot maintain moral order if you are willing to allow a few things to slide.</p>
</blockquote>
Got that? The Secret Service prostitute scandal is because gay people have been allowed in the military. Because it's weakening our morality, and making non-gay people do non-gay sex-for-hire things, and when you call them out on it they say, "I couldn't help it, there's gay people in the military now!"
<p>I was going to go into great detail as to what the flying hell Mr. Tony Perkins might be thinking, but instead I'm just going to give up here. Not being a bigot causes you to hire prostitutes. Got it. If you can decipher any deeper logic than that behind Mr. Jackass Q. Moron's remarks, please let us know in comments. Because I can't even <em>translate</em> that level of stupid. Perkins should get some sort of award for that one.<br /></p>

<p>With the GOP primary contest over, Mitt Romney has enjoyed the usual post-primary victory headlines and consolidation in his base as conservatives begin pretending to like their nominee.</p>
<p>The result is a tightening of national poll numbers:<br /></p>
<div class="dkimg-c"><iframe width='100%' height='300' frameborder='0' src='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AtlAkTpK89FudFVoVG00U3l3SDJoWWVLRm9XZ05UQ3c&amp;output=html&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;range=B2%3AF17&amp;output=html&amp;range=B2%3AF17'></iframe></div>
Of course, we don't have a national election, but the national numbers help inform the media narratives. And national numbers can be a leading indicator of shifts in the states (definitely the case in the GOP primary).
<p>We'll obviously keep an eye on the battleground state polling in the coming weeks to see if there's any tightening in Obama's <a href="http://kos.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/11/1082476/-Obama-leads-Romney-by-landslide-numbers">early big lead</a>. It certainly <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/04/obama-doing-well-in-florida.html">hasn't in Florida</a>, according to a new poll today from PPP. But that's just one data point. We'll need many more to get a clearer picture.</p>

When Rep. Paul Ryan <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/29/1078891/-Paul-Ryan-says-U-S-military-leaders-are-lying-about-budget-request">said that top military brass was lying to Congress</a>, insisting that the generals didn't give Congress their "true advice" about the proposed defense budget, he exposed a rift between the Pentagon and congressional Republicans that has prompted Kevin Baron of the <i>National Journal</i> to issue a <a href="http://nationaljournal.com/columns/the-iron-triangle/do-the-brass-support-the-obama-defense-budget--20120413">challenge</a>:<br />
<blockquote>If the senior-most Republican in the Senate knows of dissenters in the senior ranks, it's time to produce them. Put them on the witness stand and roll tape. Under the protection of giving their "best military advice," heretofore silent dissenters should tell the public why they oppose what the administration has put forth. This is national security, after all, and the nation is at war. McConnell’s and Ryan's offices didn’t respond to queries, and conservative surrogates wouldn't name names.</blockquote>
And while Ryan and the Republican leadership continue to insist—with no evidence—that the military wants a larger share of the budget, Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz says:<br />
<blockquote>"I'm not sure to whom [McConnell and Ryan] are talking, but I can tell you with certainty, it isn't the Joint Chiefs.”</blockquote>
Republicans are taking on the Pentagon, directly challenging the generals and calling them liars, for a political tool to use against President Obama. I'm old enough to remember when John Boehner would have <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2007-09-10/politics/petraeus.moveon_1_general-petraeus-liberal-advocacy-iraq?_s=PM:POLITICS">said</a> something like this was "character assassination" and "disrespectful and downright reprehensible."
<p>Meanwhile, Mitt Romney, who has embraced all things Paul Ryan, is silent. But he'll certainly say <i>something</i> about this besmirching of the nation's top generals ... as soon as he figures out which direction to shake his Etch A Sketch.</p>

There's a new ABC News/<em>WaPo</em> poll on public opinions of the tea party. The <a href="http://www.langerresearch.com/uploads/1136a6TeaParty.pdf">results (PDF)</a> aren't great for the movement.<br />
<blockquote>All told, 41 percent of Americans identify themselves as supporters of the movement, compared with a high of 47 percent last September. Forty-five percent oppose it; 14 percent have no opinion. Support has dropped disproportionately among young adults in that period, down 20 points from 51 percent to 31 percent.</blockquote>
So the kids today don't like them. Yes, shocking. This is probably worse news, though:<br />
<blockquote>Fifty percent of Americans say the more they hear about the Tea Party, the less they like it; just 27 percent say they like it more. [...]
<p>And while it’s strongly supported by 32 percent of conservative Republicans, the movement is strongly opposed by a much larger share of liberal Democrats, 62 percent. The two groups are similar in size. [...] The Tea Party has a gender gap, with 13 points more support from men than from women. And it does best with 30- to 49-year-olds, tailing off with under-30s and those 50 and older alike.</p>
</blockquote>
So support is dwindling, at least everywhere but in the Republican primaries, where crabby middle-aged white guys are treated as royalty. Even so, Mitt Romney's still courting them. Monday he spent time <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20120417_At_Phila___tax_day_summit___Romney_woos_tea_party.html">at a Tea Party Summit in Philadelphia</a>, doing the usual meaningless pandering to the group:<br />
<blockquote>"The economy is struggling because the government is too big, and we're going to bring it down to size," Romney told about 400 cheering people at the event organized by the Independence Hall Tea Party. "This campaign is going to be fun. The contrast could not be greater."
<p>President Obama "doesn't understand the power and importance of economic freedom," Romney said. "I just don't think he understands what makes America such an exceptional and successful nation."</p>
</blockquote>
Sure, whatever.
<p>A few days ago Romney went in front of the National Rifle Association and paid homage to all their most deeply held conspiracy theories about how Obama not doing a damn thing to take their guns is proof positive of a secret plan to take all their guns <em>later</em>, and now he's countering the notion that he's out of touch by going to a tea party event and saying tea partyish-things to them, even though the tea party is a net negative with the country as a whole. Sure, what the heck. I guess he's technically still in the primaries, even if his only remaining competition is Ron Paul and a <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/16/1083877/-Newt-Gingrich-bitten-by-penguin">traveling zoo aficionado</a>.</p>
