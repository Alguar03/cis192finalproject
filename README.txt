Code Organization:
------------------
1) analyzer.py 
    Class... must be initialized first!
    - accepts: filename, url_name
    - filename is the source file for all the urls spawning from the homepage, these are generated by crawler so crawler must run first!! 
    - url_name is the root url of the site we want to look at, for example, "http://www.amazon.com"
    - iterating through the list of urls, analyzer finds all the ads in each url from an ad_site_list we have hardcoded into the script
    - scores each site based on how many ads we find x links deep into the site, also the popularity of the site, and how far it is away from optimal ad % (as a % of content)
    
2) crawler.py 
    - accepts: root, crawl_depth
    - root is the root url of the site we want to look at, for example, "http://www.amazon.com"
    - crawl_depth is how many links deep we want the crawler to return. for example, crawl_depth = 1 means our crawler will return all the links in the main homepage. while crawl_depth = 2 means our crawler will follow the links in the first level, and return all the links from level 2 + level 1 + root
    
    - writes to file "./urls_inputs/root_name.txt"
    - returns out_name, root_name
    - outname is where it writes to file. i.e. "./urls_inputs/root_name.txt"
    - root_name is the stripped version of the url, i.e. www.amazon.com
    
3) main.pyw 
    - our main GUI for the program
    - calls crawler.py for a list of sites (default: top_sites.txt) and iterates through these to generate output files. Since each output file is a list of urls for a site, this is the info we need for analyzer.py
    
    - calls analyzer.py on each file generated from crawler.py, to score each site. 
    
4) top_sites.txt
    - we generated a list of top sites from compete and alexa rank.
    - main.pyw calls our scripts based on this list
